## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To use the algorithms provided in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python script in the `algorithms` directory. To use a specific algorithm, simply run its corresponding script. For example:

```bash
python decision_tree.py
```
This will execute the Decision Tree algorithm and display the results.

## üß† Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the following algorithms have been implemented:

- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

Each algorithm is well-documented with explanations of its implementation and usage.
